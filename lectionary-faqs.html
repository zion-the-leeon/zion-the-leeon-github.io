    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h1>
    <p><b><i>Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this webpage/app are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views and positions of any entities they represent.</i></b></p>
    <p><b>What inspired the making of this app/webpage?</b></p>
    <p>One of my Roman Catholic friends showed me <a href="https://universalis.com/index.htm">the Universalis</a>, which is basically an installable app that can help Roman Catholics get through the Mass. I was also always interested to learn how to make my own webpage/mobile app, and so I did this hobby project but also as a means to help my fellow Lutheran brothers and sisters. The idea is to make it open source and free for all users to use.</p>
    <p><b>Why is the King James Bible (KJV) used?</b></p>
    <p><i>Advent 2022 update: We use links to the New International Version (NIV) and English Standard Version (ESV) texts instead to optimize repository memory and offer a more recent English translation.</i></p>
    <p>Honestly I'm not a fan of using the KJV because I find it difficult to read. In fact, I prefer the <a href="https://www.esv.org/">English Standard Bible (ESV)</a>, which is used in many, if not most Lutheran churches as it is simpler to read yet preserves the literal accuracy of the original text. However, ESV is still under copyright from <a href="https://www.crossway.org/">Crossway</a> (more information on the copyright of the ESV <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/English-Standard-Version-ESV-Bible/#copy">here</a>). I didn't want to violate Crossway's copyright (as doing so would be sinning against God), so I went for the KJV as the KJV is a widely recognized English translation that is in the public domain (more information <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/King-James-Version-KJV-Bible/#copy">here</a>).</p>
    <p><b>Why are some readings "not supported"?</b></p>
    <p>Most of the readings that are not supported are (supposedly - subject to unfound bugs in the program :P) readings from the seven deuterocanonical books as the KJV source does not have these books - most Protestant bibles nowadays do not include the deuterocanonical books, even though many of the readings are in the Lutheran lectionary as Martin Luther included them as "<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Apocriefe_boeken_Lutherbijbel.jpg">Das sind Bücher, so der heiligen Schrift nicht gleich gehalten und doch nützlich und gut zu lesen sind</a>" (books that are not the same as the Holy Scripture but are useful to read).</p>
    <p><b>I have suggestions that would make the webpage/app even better!</b></p>
    <p>This is just a hobby project for me, and I'm afraid that I might not have the liberty of time to keep working on it. However, you are always welcome to fork the GitHub repositories and work on the suggestions that you'd have. :)</p>
    <p>P.S. I'd be quite happy if you manage to get Crossway's approval to use the ESV :D</p>
